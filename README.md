## Overview

This project is a fun, mobile-friendly website designed to ask that special someone "Will you be my Valentine?". It features a mischievous "No" button that evades clicks, a celebration page for "Yes", and a special hidden page for those who are persistent in saying no!

## Credits

-   **Original Code**: Inspired by [Samarth Mishra's](https://github.com/iamsamarthmishra/valentinecode_JFF) project.
-   **GIFs**: Cute animated illustrations provided by [Moobub](https://giphy.com/moobub).

## Features

-   **Interactive "No" Button**: The button playfully runs away when hovered over or clicked.
-   **Secret "No" Page**: If someone tries to click the "No" button 25 times, they are redirected to a special page asking them to "rethink" their life choices.
-   **Celebration Page**: A cute "Hurray!" page with a GIF and a link to connect further.
-   **Responsive Design**: looks great on both desktops and mobile devices with a custom pink theme.
